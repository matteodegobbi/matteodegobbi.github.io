adjustment carried out with an actor.</p><p>The consumer is a thread that consumes messages at a given fixed rate, that is, with a given delay from a shared buffer, simulating the consumed message usage.
The producer is a thread that creates messages and writes them to a shared buffer, the rate of the producer is controlled by another thread called the actor.</p><p>An actor separate from producer and consumer periodically checks the message queue length and if the length is below a given threshold, it will increase the production rate. Otherwise (i.e. the message length is above the given threshold), it will decrease the production rate.
In this case the message queue is implemented with a circular queue (or ring buffer).</p><hr><p>The main idea is to try to keep the buffer always half-full.
Meaning the objective is to have buffer utilization always close to 50%, this leaves room in both ways:
if the consumer is delayed we will still have room for inserting new data, and if the producer is delayed we still have data to consume for a while.
This way it maximizes the production rate until the buffer utilization goes over 50%. Any other threshold could be chosen and the program still works (e.g. I tried also with 70%).</p><p>I tried two approaches, both inspired by control systems, the control is carried out by changing a delay in the producer thread, this will dynamically adjust the rate of the producer to try to keep the buffer utilization at 50%.</p><p>The two controllers are:</p><ol><li>A simple threshold based control system</li><li>A PID controller</li></ol><p>Both systems share the code for the producer and the consumer.
The actor that carries out the control is different in the two solutions.
In both cases the actor runs at a fixed rate (e.g. every 1ms or 0.5ms etc.) and it checks the current buffer utilization, it then uses this information to adjust the producer&rsquo;s rate.
More information about the two methods will be given below.</p><p>It&rsquo;s important to have the actor&rsquo;s rate not too high or too low.
If the delay is too high then the actor does not have time to react to changes
in buffer utilization, leading to oscillations between the buffer being
too full and too empty.
Inversely if the delay is too small the actor will enter the critical
section too often, making the producer and consumer wait
to enter their critical section and degrading the perfomance of the two.</p><p>Unfortunately we cannot fix a rate for the actor for every task and every
system and this will need to be tuned depending on the system used.</p><p>Another important detail is the length of the buffer:
if the buffer is too small and the producer (or consumer) is carrying out
some operation, the other thread will empty (or fill) the buffer and
we don&rsquo;t have enough room to provide some leeway for the two threads
to do their work while the other one is waiting or performing some
other operations, hampering the concurrency of the system.
In most of my experiments I tried buffer sizes of 100000 and 1000000.
This problem can be witnessed with a buffer size of just 1000 or 100
the buffer utilization oscillates between 0% and 100%.
The buffer length also influences at what rate we can run the actor,
a bigger buffer allows us to run the actor less often, meaning the actor
adds less overhead to the system.</p><hr><h2 id=control-methods>Control methods</h2><p>In this section I explain the two methods I implemented to try to maximize the production rate while keeping the buffer utilization under 50%.</p><h3 id=naive-threshold-based-method>Naive threshold based method</h3><p>The first method I implemented is called <code>naive_actor</code> in the code and it loops over the following code:</p><div class=highlight><div class=chroma><table class=lntable><tr><td class=lntd><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code><span class=lnt> 1

the percent utilization of the buffer has gone above 55% or
below 45% and decreases or increases the producer&rsquo;s rate by 20%.
This approach is similar to bang-bang control in control theory
since it only activates when it&rsquo;s between two thresholds,
in this case the output is like a binary on/off that either
increases or decreases the delay by 20% independently of how far the
buffer utilization is from 50%.</p><p>The producer delay is clipped to be 1 second at most, this is not necessary with the normal setup with fixed consumer
delay but later I will explain a variation I tried where the consumer&rsquo;s delay is generated by a Cauchy random variable
and in this case this naive controller can be unstable and create high delays above 1 second in the producer.</p><p>When using the PID controller that I will explain later, this step is not needed, because even when the consumer&rsquo;s delay is
generated by a Cauchy r.v. the system is still stable without clipping.</p><p>In the figure below we can see how the naive controller performs,
the buffer utilization reaches 50%, then it overshoots
to ~57% and then starts oscillating between ~43% and ~57%,
this is expected for two reasons:</p><ol><li>The controller only works if the utilization goes outside the range [0.45,0.55],</li><li>When it changes the delay it only reacts by changing it by a fixed percentage
of the previous value. It does not use the distance from the target utilization
or the rate of change of the error,
meaning if the current utilization is 56% it will react in the same way if
the previous utilization was 55% or if it was 90%. But it should react differently,
if the previous utilization was 56% and it&rsquo;s still 56% we probably need to increase the delay,
but if it was 90% it means the consumer has increased its speed for whatever reason so
we probably won&rsquo;t need to increase the delay.</li></ol><p>This 2nd point made me think if I can incorporate in some way the rate of change,
and at this point I realized that I can use a PID controller, this way I can use the
rate of change through the derivative and I can also tune the parameters more easily,
since I just need to change 3 numbers.
Also using a PID controller the proportional term will be proportional to the error
reacting differently if the error is small or large, the naive controller always reacts
at the same speed independently from the magnitude of the error.</p><figure><img src=/example_plots/fixed_delay/naive/percent_utilization.png alt="Image 1">

Then this error is used to compute the output of the controller that will be subtracted from the current delay in a feedback loop.
We have that the output is made up of three terms:</p><ol><li>Proportional term which is proportional to the error itself, this is similar to the naive controller</li><li>Integrative term, which means proportional to the sum of past errors</li><li>Derivative term, meaning proportional to the difference between the current and previous error. (This is the part that incorporates the rate of change)</li></ol><p>The multiplicative constants K_p,K_i,K_d are read from a configuration file.</p><p>In this case we don&rsquo;t need to clip the delay to be below one second as the system is already stable, but we do need to clip it to not go below 0 as a negative delay makes no sense.</p><p>This PID actor works much better without oscillations and it just requires to try a few combinations of the parameters to work.
Some values of K_p,K_i,K_d I found that work well are 1000,0,1000, 1000,0,10000 or 10000,0,10000.</p><p>The constant K_d of the derivative term has the effect of dampening oscillations and overshoots, but if it&rsquo;s increased too much
it can make the system too slow to react to changes of regimes and to initially reach the 50% utilization.</p><p>I found that the integral term is usually not needed as there isn&rsquo;t a drift in time from the wanted output. The only set
of parameters I found an instance in which the integral term helps:
with K_p=100,K_d=10000 the system has a small steady state error
so adding a small integral term of K_i=0.01 removes this steady state error at the cost of some oscillation. Since this
steady state error can also be removed by increasing K_p without introducing oscillations I never wound up using the
integral term but I left it implemented because in some systems it could be useful to counteract systemic noise.</p><p>This example of adding the effect of adding K_i=0.01 can be seen in the figure below.</p><figure><img src=/example_plots/integral_steady_state/1percent_utilization.png alt="Image 1"><figcaption><strong>Figure 2a:</strong> Buffer utilization percentage with PID controller and Kp=100,Ki=0,Kd=10000.

rate, to do this is decided to generate the delay of the consumer with a Cauchy random variable with center 100 and scale
parameter 100.</p><p>I choose a Cauchy rv because it has very high variability and is unpredictable, the median of this delay will still be 100 microseconds but
much higher delays can be generated, still I clipped the delay to not be more than 1e6 microseconds (1 second) to avoid very long wait times.</p><p>Just to see how variable this delay is we can run this R script:</p><div class=highlight><div class=chroma><table class=lntable><tr><td class=lntd><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code><span class=lnt>1

But the maxes are very different: 475.0348 for the gaussian and 55947.0 for the Cauchy. And this is with only 1000 samples,
increasing the number of samples would highlight the difference even further as Cauchy r.v.&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t have a finite variance.</p><p>So the system needs to be able to act quickly in order to counteract this kind of spikes in delays.</p><p>Now I will show some plots overviewing the behaviour of the two controllers when dealing with this Cauchy delay.</p><figure><img src=/example_plots/cauchy/naive_cauchy/percent_utilization.png alt="Image 1">

The naive controller goes from delay 0 to 10 seconds of delay (this is the reason why after I added the clipping to 1 second)
in some systems (e.g. my laptop) this is very drastic and can hang the system for a long time, the buffer utilization is always between
40% and 60% but it&rsquo;s more unstable.</p><p>With the same setup the PID controller is much more stable having spikes only when the consumer has a long delay
and quickly reaching 50% again by adjusting the producer rate. The controller also doesn&rsquo;t reach very long delays as it can
respond in a more stable manner, reaching at most 60000 microseconds delay against 1e7 microseconds (or more) of the naive controller.</p><hr><h2 id=how-to-run-the-experiments>How to run the experiments</h2><p>You need to have installed <code>gcc</code> and <code>make</code> in a POSIX compatible machine with pthreads (I tested the code on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS on a x86 machine and MacOS Sequoia 15.5 on a ARM machine)</p><p>For the plotting you need to have installed <code>python</code> with the libraries <code>pandas</code> and <code>matplotlib</code>.</p><p>To run the experiment you can set the PID constants in the text config file <code>pid_constants.txt</code> and run</p><div class=highlight><div class=chroma><table class=lntable><tr><td class=lntd><pre tabindex=0 class=chroma><code><span class=lnt>1
